# Global Mortality Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a synthetic global mortality dataset. 
It uncovers patterns in causes of death, trends over time, country-wise mortality burden, age-group vulnerabilities, and gender-specific risks. 
The goal is to generate actionable insights for public health planning, policy-making, and awareness campaigns.

**Dataset:**  
- Synthetic, globally representative mortality data  
- Columns: Year, Country, Gender, Age_Group, Cause_of_Death, Number_of_Deaths, Mortality_Rate_per_1000

## Key Insights

1. **Leading Causes of Death**  
   - Identified top mortality drivers such as cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and accidents.  

2. **Mortality Trend Over Time**  
   - Analyzed year-wise death trends to detect spikes and declines.  

3. **Country-wise Mortality Burden**  
   - Highlighted countries with the highest overall mortality.  

4. **Cause of Death by Age Group**  
   - Explored how causes differ across age groups.  

5. **Gender-wise Mortality Patterns**  
   - Compared mortality between males and females.  

> Charts and visualizations are available in the `visuals/` folder (to be added).
